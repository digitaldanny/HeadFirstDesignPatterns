# Repo Description

This repo contains my personal solutions (or solution attempts) while reading through the textbook "Head First Design Patterns" by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson.

The textbook examples are given in Java, but my solutions will be in C++ since that is the language I primarily use in my job.

# Repo Organization

Each chapter has its own folder in this repo, and individual puzzles or "design challenges" will have their own subfolder. Each chapter's README will contain my notes from the textbook, along with links to other references I used to clarify details.

Design challenge subfolders contain a README with notes about my solutions.

Design challenge subfolders will may also contain files copied from previous exercises, as sequential challenges sometimes build upon each other. This is a rare instance where I am allowing code duplication just to make referencing these files easier in the future.
